Hi! My name is Carolina Padrão. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Political Science and International Relations, with a minor in Quantitative Political Analysis.

I created this website to present selected work from my final year assignments, showcasing my analytical and data visualisation skills in R. 

Enjoy! 🙂🙌
